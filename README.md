## JavaPAOne - CSCI 3920 Programming Assignment for PA#1

### Program Summary
Upon the start of the program, it will prompt the user if they'd like to:
1. Load Database from a File
2. Start Server

If prompted to 'Start the Server,' a login window will appear asking the user to either sign in, depending on the account type, it will prompt different windows to appear.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Only an admin account can manipulate the data for the store system and if the program detects a 'Admin' login, it will only prompt the Admin Application. If the system detects a Customer has signed in, it will prompt the Customer Catalog Application. The Admin account will not be able to view the catalog application otherwise or vice versa for a Customer account. 

Admin Username: admin                                                   Admin Password: password

Customer Username: user                                                 Customer Password: pw 

Our department store should be able to support many customers/clients all at once. However, there will be one admin account which have options to manipulate products, categories, and orders.
