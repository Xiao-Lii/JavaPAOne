## JavaPAOne - CSCI 3920 Programming Assignment for PA#1

### Program Summary
Upon the start of the program, it will prompt the user if they'd like to:
1. Load Database from a File
2. Start Server

<b>Note for Option 1: At the moment we currently don't have a pre-saved database file that can be used to load into the database! </b>

If prompted to 'Start the Server,' a login window will appear without prompting the user for an IP address or port # and will connect the user automatically; depending on the account type, it will prompt different windows to appear.

<p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> Only an admin account can manipulate the data for the store system and if the program detects a 'Admin' login, it will only prompt the Admin Application. If the system detects a Customer has signed in, it will prompt the Customer Catalog Application. An Admin account will not be able access or view the catalog application. </p>

<b>Admin Username: admin ------------------- Admin Password: password

Customer Username: user ------------------- Customer Password: pw </b>

Our department store should be able to support many customers/clients all at once. For convenience, there will be only one pre-built Admin Account which will have all the options to manipulate products, categories, users, orders, etc. There will also be one pre-built customer account that may only access the Catalog Application.
